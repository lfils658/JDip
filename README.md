# JDip
JDip is an online web portal for your needs.

## ABOUT
My uncle, John DiPlacido, made a web portal for our family. Originally called ".: John's Home Page :.", it had many web portal features: a news feed, chatroom, guestbook, ect. Unfortunately, Uncle Johnny passed a few years back. I decided to remake it in his name, and titled it "The J" as a tibute to him. Here I am sharing some original snippets of the source code (retrieved from the Internet Archive, located in the [`old`](https://github.com/lfils658/JDip/tree/old) branch), as well as my new code. in the [`main`](https://github.com/lfils658/JDip/tree/main) branch.

## The Plan

We will use some of the origional compoets to create a new web portal. 
NOTE: Origional compontest will be marked with a tribute to Uncle J. 

Features:


New Code                                       | Recycled Origional Code                         
---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------
Create an account (Users)                      | Google Search (May voilate Google TOS)           
News feed                                      | Games (becasue they are still cool)              
Weather feed                                   |                                                  
Quick access links                             |                                                  

There will also be sone code to be archived. We could possible repupose this code in the lat stages of the project:

Archived Code                                  | Posible Repurposement
---------------------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------
