JDip is an online web portal for your needs.

## ABOUT
My uncle, John DiPlacido, made a web portal for our family. Origionally ".: John's Home Page :.", it had many web portal features: a new feed, chatroom, guestbook, ect. Unfortunetly, Uncle Johnny passed a few years back. I decided to remake it in his name, and titled it "The J". Here I am shareing some origional snipbits of the source code (retrived from the Internet Archive, in the "/old/" folder ), as well as my new code. in "main".
