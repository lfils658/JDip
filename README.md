# JDip
JDip is an online web portal for your needs.

## ABOUT
My uncle, John DiPlacido, made a web portal for our family. Originally called ".: John's Home Page :.", it had many web portal features: a new feed, chatroom, guestbook, ect. Unfortunately, Uncle Johnny passed a few years back. I decided to remake it in his name, and titled it "The J". Here I am sharing some original snippets of the source code (retrieved from the Internet Archive, located in the [`old`](https://github.com/lfils658/JDip/tree/old) branch), as well as my new code. in the [`main`](https://github.com/lfils658/JDip/tree/main) branch.

## IMPORTANT
Some portions of the original code have been exempted from the repository because it contained confedential information.
